# Shelter Classifier App

The Shelter Classifier App is a web application that allows users to upload images of trees, and it uses two machine learning models (Convolutional Neural Network - CNN and Decision Tree Classifier) to predict whether the tree is suitable as a shelter or not.

## Features

- interface for uploading images.
- Integration of a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) and Decision Tree Classifier for image classification.
- Prediction results displayed to the user.
- Flask backend serving as the API.

## Technologies Used

- React.js (Frontend)
- Flask (Backend)
- Convolutional Neural Network (sklearn)
- Decision Tree Classifier (sklear)
- OpenCV


### Prerequisites

- Node.js and npm
- Python and pip
